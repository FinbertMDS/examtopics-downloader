# Exam Topics Downloader

This repo aims to make it possible for you to obtain all the exam questions from the examtopics website (which is paywalled).

## Setting it Up

1. First, you must install [Golang >= 1.24](https://go.dev/doc/install) from the offical website.
2. Then, run `git clone https://github.com/thatonecodes/examtopics-downloader` in your terminal to clone the repo.
3. `cd` into the directory: `cd examtopics-downloader`
4. You can now run: `go run . (args...)`

(there will be compiled binaries in the future)

## Command Line Arguments

```bash
Each command line argument you can provide when running the program:

  -c	Optionally include all the comment/discussion text
  -o string
    	Optional path of the file where the data will be outputted (default "examtopics_output.md")
  -p string
    	Name of the exam provider (default -> google) (default "google")
  -s string
    	String to grep for in discussion links (required)
  -save-links
    	Optional argument to save unique links to questions
```

## Example

So, you have installed `go` on your system, and you're inside of the working directory. Let's say you would like the questions for the cisco exam 200-301.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
go run . -p cisco -s 200-301
```

Note that you can put the id as the string to look for, as the program is compatible this way also.

After waiting a few moments, you would see the output end with:

```bash
Successfully saved output to {OUTPUT_LOCATION}.
```

If so, hooray, you have successfully saved all/most of the questions in a `.md` file!
The format would be such as:

```
