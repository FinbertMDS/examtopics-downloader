# Exam Topics Downloader

This repo aims to make it possible for you to obtain all the exam questions from the examtopics website (which is paywalled).

## Setting it Up

### Using docker

1. Make sure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed on your system.
2. Pull the docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/thatonecodes/examtopics-downloader:latest
```

3\. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d \
 --name examtopics-downloader \
 -p google -s devops \
 -save-links -o output.md \

### `-save-links` && `-output-save-links`

This is a bool flag, so the default is that it's set to `false`, deactivated. If `-save-links` is false `-output-save-links` will do nothing.
`-output-save-links` is a `string` which includes the output path for the saved links, default is `saved-links.txt`.

### Grep String, `-s`

The `-s` argument can take an exam ID (ex. 200-301) or a word, such as "devops". for example:

```bash
go run . -p google -s devops
```

would get all exams from the `google` provider containing the string `devops`.

### Comments and output, `-c` && `-o`

The `-c` argument is another bool flag, so it is defaultly set to false(as it creates a lot of noise in the `.md` file), but you can include it by adding the flag.
`-o` is the output path, based on `os.create(path)`, in the current working directory.

### Exams output, `-exams`

This argument will display output defaulted to such as and exit immediately.

## Example

So, you have installed `go` on your system, and you're inside of the working directory. Let's say you would like the questions for the cisco exam 200-301.

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
go run . -p cisco -s 200-301
```

Note that you can put the id as the string to look for, as the program is compatible this way also.

After waiting a few moments, you would see the output end with:

```bash
Successfully saved output to {OUTPUT_LOCATION}.
```

If so, hooray, you have successfully saved all/most of the questions in a `.md` file!
The format would be such as:
